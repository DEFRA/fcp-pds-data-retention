# FCP Payment & Document Services Data Retention Service

Service responsible for reading and distributing data regarding Defra farming agreement end dates. The service reads ZIP files containing a CSV with the data retention data, including FRN, Agreement Number, Scheme and End Date. Using this, a database table is updated with these details, which is then polled at regular intervals to determine data past its 7 year retention period. Assuming this has passed, the service distributes a JSON message to a dedicated service bus topic and wipes the data from its own database.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

Optional:
- Kubernetes
- Helm

## Running the application

The application is designed to run in containerised environments, using Docker Compose in development and Kubernetes in production.

- A Helm chart is provided for production deployments to Kubernetes.

### Build container image

Container images are built using Docker Compose, with the same images used to run the service with either Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

When using the Docker Compose files in development the local `app` folder will
be mounted on top of the `app` folder within the Docker container, hiding the CSS files that were generated during the Docker build.  For the site to render correctly locally `npm run build` must be run on the host system.


By default, the start script will build (or rebuild) images so there will
rarely be a need to build images manually. However, this can be achieved
through the Docker Compose
[build](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/build/) command:

```
# Build container images
docker compose build
```

### Start

Use Docker Compose to run service locally.

```
docker compose up
```

## Test structure

The tests have been structured into subfolders of `./test` as per the
[Microservice test approach and repository structure](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FPS/pages/1845396477/Microservice+test+approach+and+repository+structure)

### Running tests

A convenience script is provided to run automated tests in a containerised
environment. This will rebuild images before running tests via docker-compose,
using a combination of `docker-compose.yaml` and `docker-compose.test.yaml`.
The command given to `docker-compose run` may be customised by passing
arguments to the test script.

Examples:

```
# Run all tests
scripts/test

# Run tests with file watch
scripts/test -w
```

## CI pipeline

This service uses the [FFC CI pipeline](https://github.com/DEFRA/ffc-jenkins-pipeline-library)

### Provisioning

After updating the `provision.azure` file with the correct information, the pipeline will create the required resources automatically
At the moment the following resources provisioning automatically:
- Managed Identity
- PostgreSql Database
- Service Bus Queue
- Service Bus Topic
- Service Bus Subscription

The permissions to the mentioned resources will be automatically granted by the pipeline.

### Using Workload Identity

Database:

```
const { DefaultAzureCredential, getBearerTokenProvider } = require('@azure/identity')

function isProd () {
  return process.env.NODE_ENV === production
}

const dbConfig = {
  username: process.env.POSTGRES_USERNAME,
  password: process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
  database: process.env.POSTGRES_DB,
  schema: process.env.POSTGRES_SCHEMA_NAME || 'public',
  host: process.env.POSTGRES_HOST || 'localhost',
  port: process.env.POSTGRES_PORT || 5432,
  logging: process.env.POSTGRES_LOGGING || false,
  dialect: 'postgres',
  dialectOptions: {
    ssl: isProd()
  },
  hooks: {
    beforeConnect: async (cfg) => {
      if (isProd()) {
        const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential({ managedIdentityClientId: process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_ID })
        const tokenProvider = getBearerTokenProvider(
          credential,
          'https://ossrdbms-aad.database.windows.net/.default'
        )
        cfg.password = tokenProvider
      }
    }
  },

```

Service Bus:

```
const mqSchema = joi.object({
  messageQueue: {
    host: joi.string().default('localhost'),
    useCredentialChain: joi.bool().default(false),
    type: joi.string(),
    appInsights: joi.object(),
    username: joi.string().optional(),
    password: joi.string().optional(),
    managedIdentityClientId: joi.string().optional()
  },
  applyQueue: queueSchema
})

const mqConfig = {
  messageQueue: {
    host: process.env.MESSAGE_QUEUE_HOST,
    useCredentialChain: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    type: 'queue',
    appInsights: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? require('applicationinsights') : undefined,
    username: process.env.MESSAGE_QUEUE_USER,
    password: process.env.MESSAGE_QUEUE_PASSWORD,
    managedIdentityClientId: process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_ID
  },
  {{ TheServiceQueue }}: {
    address: process.env.APPLY_QUEUE_ADDRESS
  }
}

```

For Storage account and other resources pass the azure client id to the `DefaultAzureCredential` method:
```
new DefaultAzureCredential({ managedIdentityClientId: process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_ID })
```
